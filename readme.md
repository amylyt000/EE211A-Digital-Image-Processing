# EE211A project: Prediction of Hemorrhage in the brain from MRI

Group: Yutong Lu, Xin Zeng

In this project, we basically designed and implemented a CNN structure in Tensorflow for the prediction of area and extent of hemorrhagic
transformation in brain MRI images, and it shows that CNN performs best among all structures we have used.
